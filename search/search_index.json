Discussion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/","text":"Problem 2 Projectile Motion: Theory, Formulas, and Examples 1. Introduction Projectile motion refers to the motion of an object under the influence of gravity, assuming no air resistance. It consists of two independent components: - Horizontal Motion : Constant velocity motion. - Vertical Motion : Uniformly accelerated motion due to gravity. 2. Useful Definitions Initial velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ): The speed at which the object is launched. Angle of projection ( \\(\\theta\\) ): The angle at which the object is launched with respect to the horizontal. Acceleration due to gravity ( \\(g\\) ): The constant acceleration experienced due to Earth's gravity. Typically, \\(g = 9.81 \\, m/s^2\\) . Time of flight ( \\(t_f\\) ): The total time the projectile remains in the air. Maximum height ( \\(H\\) ): The highest vertical position the projectile reaches. Range ( \\(R\\) ): The horizontal distance covered by the projectile. 3. Governing Equations of Motion (a) Horizontal Motion Since there is no acceleration in the horizontal direction: $$ x = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t $$ (b) Vertical Motion Using kinematic equations for motion under gravity: $$ y = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ 4. Key Formulas (a) Time of Flight The projectile reaches the ground when \\(y = 0\\) . Solving for \\(t\\) : $$ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} $$ (b) Maximum Height The maximum height occurs when vertical velocity becomes zero: $$ H = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin^2\\theta}{2g} $$ (c) Range of the Projectile The horizontal distance traveled before returning to the ground: $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} $$ (d) Velocity Components at Any Time Horizontal velocity: $ v_x = v_0 \\cos\\theta $ Vertical velocity: $ v_y = v_0 \\sin\\theta - g t $ 5. Examples Example 1: Finding Time of Flight and Range A projectile is launched with an initial velocity of \\(v_0 = 20\\) m/s at an angle of \\(45^\\circ\\) . Find: 1. The time of flight. 2. The range of the projectile. Solution: Given: - \\(v_0 = 20\\) m/s - \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) - \\(g = 9.81\\) m/s\u00b2 Step 1: Compute Time of Flight $$ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} = \\frac{2 \\times 20 \\times \\sin 45^\\circ}{9.81} $$ $$ t_f \\approx 2.87 \\text{ s} $$ Step 2: Compute Range $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} = \\frac{20^2 \\sin 90^\\circ}{9.81} $$ $$ R \\approx 40.8 \\text{ m} $$ Example 2: Maximum Height A ball is thrown with an initial velocity of \\(15\\) m/s at an angle of \\(30^\\circ\\) . Find the maximum height. Solution: $$ H = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin^2\\theta}{2g} $$ $$ H = \\frac{15^2 \\sin^2 30^\\circ}{2 \\times 9.81} $$ $$ H \\approx 2.86 \\text{ m} $$ 6.
